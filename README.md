  - The bird will fall due to gravity if you don't flap.
  - Time your flaps to help the bird clear gaps between pipes.

- **Game Rules:**  
  - The pipes move horizontally from right to left.
  - You score a point every time you pass through a gap.
  - The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or flies off the screen.
